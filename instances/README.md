This directory contains instances for the separator problem, consisting of some real-world data or common datasets as
well as custom graphs with interesting properties to test the algorithms on.
Many instance types were directly taken from [Holzer et al. 2005].

# Notes

## Triangular Graphs
In [Holzer et al. 2005], the construction of triangular graphs is described as a recursive process that splits a 
triangle in a Sierpinski-like fashion. This results in a triangular graph that looks like a pyramid, with n nodes in the 
bottom layer, n-1 nodes in the layer above etc. which results in (n^2 + n) / 2 nodes in total. 
It is perfectly possible to create such a graph with 5050 nodes and 14850 edges, as stated in the paper - just create a
pyramid with a base size of 100. But this has to be done in an iterative fashion, as is done here. The recursive 
algorithm described in the paper "skips" the graph of this size. See code for details.

## Random Graphs
The largest random instances contain 512,000 nodes, resulting in files that exceed the size limit recommended by GitHub.
Therefore, these instances are not included here but should be generated locally instead.
